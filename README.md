# Game of life - 3D

This is a 3D implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using the Godot Engine for visualization and compute shaders for the simulation.

*The project is very barebones and was meant to be a learning experience of Godot and compute shaders. It is not a finalized project and probably never will be.*
